<h2> Synopsis</h2>
<p>
After the death of his father, T'Challa returns home to the African nation
of Wakanda to take his rightful place as king. When a powerful enemy
suddenly reappears, T'Challa's mettle as king and as Black Panther gets tested
when he's drawn into a conflict that puts the fate of Wakanda and the entire
world at risk. Faced with treachery and danger, the young king must rally his
allies and release the full power of Black Panther to defeat his foes and secure
 the safety of his people.
