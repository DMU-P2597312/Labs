<!-- I unfortunately couldn't put a second trailer in as it would keep going over the sizde limit and
even all the conversion sites i used couldn't keep the quality and the size down. -->

<p> The film's plot takes place two years after Welcome to the Jungle, in which
  the same group of teenagers, along with an old friend and two unwitting additions,
  become trapped in Jumanji. There, they all find themselves facing new problems and
  challenges with both old and new avatars while having to save the land from a new villain in order to escape.
