    <h1>Dogs become valuable employees at major bank</h1>
  </head>
  <p>It was revealed this morning that a major high street bank
    has <strong>begun employing clever canines</strong> to perform basic
    data-entry tasks in several of its UK data centres. In a statement earlier
    today a spokesperson for the bank said that training had gone well with
    the <strong>first intake of ten pooches</strong> and that overall they were
    just happy to be involved.</p>

        I'll have earned enough for a deposit on my own kennel"</p>

<h2 style="color: red;">Businesses Suited to Animal Employees</h2>

<h3>Many businesses could benefit from embracing our feathered and furry friends
 in the workplace.</h3>

<h2 style="color: red;">Cafes</h2>

<h3>Perhaps you've been to a cat cafe already? Relax with a coffee and be
 soothed by the elegant slow dance and soft purring of some
 feline friends.</h3>

<h2 style="color: red;">Hospitals</h2>

<h3>Hospitals often have a need to move small things like sample tubes and
  paperwork to other parts of the hospital quickly, often along long narrow
  corridors. Parrots would be perfectly suited to this role, and would also
  help brighten things up, adding a little cheer for those enjoying
  a temporary stay.</h3>

<h2 style="color: red;">Window Cleaning</h2>

<h3>If window cleaners used Pelicans to hold their water, instead of carrying
   a bucket up a ladder, it's estimated that 356 window cleaning injuries a
   year could be avoided. They're also good company on a lunch break.</h3>
